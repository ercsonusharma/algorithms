1....(z[idx]) z-algo keeps the no. of characters matched with the pattern (from 0...length of pattern)
thereafter(imp) the certain index (index=> idx in  z[idx] )
e.g. original pattern= abababc  (str)
for z[4]=2 since only two characters matches with the original pattern i.e. ab

It is applied over the concatenated string of pattern with the text i.e. pattern$text

only once..  :- z-algo(length of concatenated string)

2....kmplcp keeps the no. of characters matched till now(imp) with the original pattern
e.g. original pattern= abababc (str)
for lcp[4]=3 and lcp[5]=4
lcp[4]=3 tells that 3 characters have matched till index 4 ie. abc with the oringinal pattern

because it is used for sliding window so it keeps the index to thereafter which the matching
is to be started with the text to reduce the complexity ,here lcp[5]=4 where 4 is the index where again
we have to start our searching from with the text

Two times:- i) for calculating lcp
			ii)for matching string with pattern
