For  weighted both:-
1.Longest Path In Tree(Undirected):-
		two bfs:- one from starting node e.g. 1 and another from the node whose d[] vector is maximum.
		
			2.For unweighted tree undirected:-  take weight as 1
			
			Note:----- both the algo are almost similar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.Longest Path in DAG(weighted directed Tree ):-
					Topological sorting 
						algo can be found in the same directory
		take weight =1 for unweighted tree
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alternative to 3:- 

4.For tree (directed unweighted):- Diameter of tree

Centre:- The node whose eccentricity is minimum.
Eccentricity:- The distance of node farthest from one.
Tree has one or two centre.
