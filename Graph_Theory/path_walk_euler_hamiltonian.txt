Walk:- no edges are repeated..
Path:- no edges and vertices are repeated...
Circuit:- path in which only initial and the final vertices are repeated only....



Hamiltonian Path: 
				Hamiltonian path not line...
				a closed walk having no vertices repeated i.e. =>simply a path
				in which all the vertices are covered but not necessarily all the edges.
.	
				Hamiltonian circuit:- circuit having above property..
					

		Property=> there are (n-1)/2 number of edge disjoint Hamiltonian circuit 
					having n vertices in COMPLETE GRAPH only...


Euler Graph:	Euler Line=>	
				a closed walk => walk		i.e. vertex may repeat
					in which all the edges must be covered not necessarily all the vertex 
					
				property=>	all the degrees must be even.. for a graph to be euler ...
